# YAModInstaller
Small script for installing mods in Yakuza games

I made this for my Yakuza 6 Bakamitai mod, but feel free to use this for your own mods as long as you credit me.

# How to use
## Setting it up
If you want to add files to .par files, make a new folder in "files/add/data". Make sure to follow the game's file layout. If the folder is supposed to be a .par, end the name with ".par". Example: "test.par"

If you want to replace or add files (not par), put the files to "files/replace/data". Again, make sure to follow the game's file layout. 

If you want to exclude any files from being backed up (for example files that you added that don't exist in the original game), add them to "backup_exclude.txt". Each file is one line.
## Installing the mod
Get [ParTool](https://github.com/Kaplas80/ParManager/releases) if you haven't done so already.

Run the script/exe and follow the on-screen instructions.
